### Publishing to Maven Central with `com.vanniktech.maven.publish` Plugin

This guide explains how to set up and publish your Kotlin Multiplatform library to Maven Central using
`com.vanniktech.maven.publish` Gradle plugin.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A Maven Central account.
- Your project is set up to use Gradle.
- A GPG key for signing artifacts.

### Step 1: Configure `gradle.properties`

Add the following properties to your `gradle.properties` file to set up signing and Maven credentials:

```properties
signing.keyId=<GPG Key ID>
signing.password=<GPG Key Password>
signing.secretKeyRingFile=<path to secret key ring file>
mavenCentralUsername=<Sonatype Username>
mavenCentralPassword=<Sonatype Password>
```

Note: Ensure your gradle.properties file is not included in version control or consider using environment variables to
keep your credentials secure.

### Step 2: Add the Maven Publish Plugin to build.gradle.kts

Add `com.vanniktech.maven.publish` plugin to your `build.gradle.kts:`

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.vanniktech.maven.publish") version "0.30.0"
}
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Library's build.gradle.kts

Ensure that your build.gradle.kts has the necessary metadata for your project:

```kotlin
mavenPublishing {
    // Define coordinates for the published artifact
    coordinates(
        groupId = "com.group.package.id", // Your maven central namespace e.g io.github.dalafiarisamuel
        artifactId = "library", // library
        version = "0.0.1" // version
    )

    // Configure POM metadata for the published artifact
    pom {
        name.set("Your library name")
        description.set("A brief description of your library.")
        inceptionYear.set("2024") //or year of publication
        url.set("https://github.com/your/repository")

        licenses {
            license {
                name.set("MIT")
                url.set("https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT")
            }
        }

        // Specify developers information
        developers {
            developer {
                id.set("yourId e.g devTamuno")
                name.set("Your Name")
                email.set("Your Email")
            }
        }

        // Specify SCM information
        scm {
            url.set("https://github.com/your/repository")
        }
    }

    // Configure publishing to Maven Central
    publishToMavenCentral(SonatypeHost.CENTRAL_PORTAL)

    // Enable GPG signing for all publications
    signAllPublications()
}

kotlin {
    androidTarget {
        publishLibraryVariants("release")
    }
}

```

### Step 4: Generate and Upload GPG Key

To sign your artifacts, you need a GPG key:

1. Run the command: ```gpg --full-generate-key```
    - When the terminal asks "Please select what kind of key you want:" Enter 1 for RSA and RSA
    - When the terminal asks "RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long." Enter 4096
    - When the terminal asks "Please specify how long the key should be valid." enter 0 for `key does not expire` and
      respond `y` for "Key does not expire at all?".
    - Continue the process by inputting your real name, email address and comment (this can be blank)
    - Enter a password you'll remember to sign your key

    <br>

2. Export your GPG key and Setup Credentials:
    - List generate keys by running this command: ```gpg --list-secret-keys```
    - Copy the long form of the newly generated gpg key e.g `574DEB97803CD28D5F07A4054DCE5983654E7199`
    - Export your key to base64 PGP private key block
      `--armor --export-secret-keys 574DEB97803CD28D5F07A4054DCE5983654E7199 | pbcopy` N/B: this will be copied to your
      clipboard. you can paste it into another file before you contiue to the next step.
    - Save exported key to a `.gpg` file by running this command:
      ```echo "paste the exported base64 key block" | gpg --dearmor > ~/secring.gpg```. This should generate a file
      secring.gpg in your root directory.
    - Upload your key to a public repository. This step is compulsory, as it's the only way Maven Central can validate
      the files you're uploading: ```--keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key 574DEB97803CD28D5F07A4054DCE5983654E7199```
    - Check the email address attached to that key, you should get an email asking you to verify the email address.
      follow the prompt and verify the email address accordingly.

3. Setup Token-Based Authentication
   * Login to your Maven Central account
   * Click on your Profile --> `View Account`
   * Click on `Generate User Token`
   * If you can't remember your last generated token, generate another.
   * Copy username and password, as they'll be used in the next step.

    <br>

4. Set up your key in `gradle.properties` as shown earlier.
    ```properties
    signing.keyId=//last 8 characters of your key e.g  654E7199
    signing.password=// password from Step 2
    signing.secretKeyRingFile=// path to your secring.gpg file
    mavenCentralUsername=//sonar username copied from Step 3
    mavenCentralPassword=//sonar password copied from Step 3
   ```


### Step 5: Push to Maven Central
- Make sure your app builds and runs üëÄ
- Run this gradle command to push your package to maven central:
      ```./gradlew publishToMavenCentral --no-configuration-cache```.
- After the gradle task is completed, goto your `Maven Central Profile` --> `View Deployments`.
- If you carried out these steps correctly, you should see your package being processed and verified by Maven. You have
   two options, to `Drop` or `Publish`. If it fails to validate your build, your gpg public key is probably not
      available in the public repository. Kindly retry `Step 4`.
- After publishing is successful, verify your library is now visible on Maven Central by searching for the namespace.
